### This project has some abstractions and examples of our development processes.

Mainly we write our code using only function components and hooks (React 16.8.0 and above). 
Also in some rare cases we use sagas for more complex pages and components.

##### Here you can see:
* Feature example (./feature)
* Basic hooks for api requests (./hooks)
* Request instance with some jsonapi helpers (./request)

We can't show everything you know but here's we sure enough to understand main idea.
